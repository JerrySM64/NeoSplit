# NeoSplit - LiveSplit for the rest of us

*Quick disclaimer: I won't post a screenshot or a release yet as the application is still very WIP. If you want to try it, clone this repo, install Xcode on your Mac and compile it yourself!*


## Why was this project started?
I started this project because I speedrun Mario Kart 64: Amped Up!. They have the requirement to have a timer being shown, but LiveSpilt doesn't support macOS (or Linux) and I couldn't find a suitable alternative for macOS. So I decided to make my own, dusting off my Swift skills while at it.

## Features
Since this project is still at the very beginning, it supports is the timer and UI customization. NeoSplit is nowhere near done, so stay tuned!

## System Requirements
* macOS Ventura or later (x86 or Apple Silicon)
